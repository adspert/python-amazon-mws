Feeds
#####

According to `Amazon's documentation
<https://docs.developer.amazonservices.com/en_US/feeds/Feeds_Overview.html>`_:

  The Amazon MWS Feeds API section of the Amazon Marketplace Web Service
  (Amazon MWS) API lets you upload inventory and order data to Amazon.
  You can also use the Amazon MWS Feeds API section to get information about
  the processing of feeds.

More details on how to utilize the Feeds API per MWS requirements can be
found at the above link. Below we'll provide details on how to use this API
with :py:class:`Feeds <mws.apis.feeds.Feeds>`.
